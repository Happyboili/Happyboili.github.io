### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

    The lab was fun and I enjoyed learning more about how Object Oriented Programming works in C++ and its implementation into classes and encapsulation. I was able to learn more about how to use google styling and seeing how different it was from the style I was used to.

* Lab 9

    This lab introduced me to the concept of IO and reading and writing files in C++. I was able to learn more about how it works and also how reading and writing files uses vectors to store the data and how to use and sort them depending on the file format and data.

* Lab 12

    The Lab was fun and interesting in terms of the complexity of the API and making new images and animations to gif file formats. Also there is a intersting on how the API works. There is intersting parts of it that goes over some of the loops and storing it in vectors but overall the lab was fun and to see the results to be even better.
